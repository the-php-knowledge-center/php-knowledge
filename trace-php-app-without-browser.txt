* The whole idea here is to construct a pure cli way to trace a php web application without using a web browser.
* We can have a generic script, maybe named profile.php, the script will read different [profile_name].profile.json file.
* In a [profile-name].profile.json, we can make it look like:
{
   "document_root": "...",
   "script_name": "index.php",
   "Cookie": {
      "key1": "val1",
      "key2": "val2",
      ...
   }
}
