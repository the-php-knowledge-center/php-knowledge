SPX's can profile both web and console apps.

For web apps, it can only provide full report, while for the console app, it can provide:
fp	Flat profile	The flat profile provided by SPX. It is the default report type and is directly printed on STDERR.
full	Full report	This is the report type for web UI. Reports will be stored in SPX data directory and thus will be available for analysis on web UI side.
trace	Trace file	A custom format (human readable text) trace file.

SPX's profile data by default is generated at /tmp/spx

The raw text file is contained at one of the .gz file, we can use gunzip to open the gz and extract the text information

(We might be able to get the function call and file trace information by extracting the information in the text file)
